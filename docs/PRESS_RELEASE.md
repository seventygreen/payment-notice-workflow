# Altra-CPG Automates Accounts Receivable Dispute Management, Recovers $2.4M Annually in Invalid Deductions

## AI-Powered Payment Notice Processing Reduces Manual Review Time by 95%, Enabling CPG Brands to Scale Profitably with Major Retailers

**ATLANTA, GA – January 2027** – Altra-CPG, a leading coffee products manufacturer, today announced the successful deployment of an AI-powered accounts receivable automation system that has transformed how the company manages payment deductions from major retail distributors including Dollar General, Kroger, Walmart, and Sam's Club. The system has recovered $2.4 million annually in invalid deductions while reducing manual processing time from 8 hours per payment notice to under 5 minutes.

**The Problem: Death by a Thousand Deductions**

CPG brands lose billions annually to retailer deductions—charges taken by distributors for alleged violations like damaged goods, routing errors, compliance failures, and pricing discrepancies. For mid-sized brands like Altra-CPG, validating these deductions is a manual nightmare: AR teams spend weeks each month cross-referencing payment notices against complex vendor compliance guides, hunting for supporting evidence, and preparing dispute packages. With each major retailer having unique requirements and dozens of deduction codes, the process doesn't scale. The result: companies either accept invalid deductions to avoid the manual burden (accepting 15-30% margin erosion) or hire expensive teams that still can't keep pace.

"Before automation, our AR team spent 60% of their time validating deductions instead of strategic work," said Michael Chen, CFO of Altra-CPG. "We were losing $200,000 monthly to deductions we legally didn't owe, simply because we couldn't process disputes fast enough. With 40 payment notices weekly across four distributors, each requiring 4-8 hours of manual review, we faced a choice: accept the losses or scale our team. Neither was viable."

**The Solution: Contract-Aware AI That Thinks Like Your Best AR Analyst**

Altra-CPG's automation system combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with AI agents to validate deductions in real-time. When a payment notice arrives via email, the system:

1. **Ingests Everything** – Automatically extracts remittance advice and supporting evidence from emails and attachments (PDFs, spreadsheets, images, scanned documents) regardless of format
2. **Understands Contracts** – Queries a vector database loaded with vendor compliance guides, master agreements, and historical precedents to retrieve the exact contract clauses governing each deduction type
3. **Validates Claims** – An AI agent analyzes each deduction against contract terms, examining evidence quality, verifying calculations, checking procedural compliance (filing deadlines, documentation requirements), and identifying violations
4. **Makes Decisions** – Categorizes deductions as Valid (accept), Invalid (dispute), or Needs Review (human escalation) with detailed reasoning and contract citations
5. **Generates Disputes** – Automatically drafts professional dispute packages including counter-evidence from the ERP system, contract references, and point-by-point rebuttals
6. **Closes the Loop** – Posts validated deductions to NetSuite and tracks dispute resolutions to improve future accuracy

The system handles multi-format evidence including damage photos (using computer vision), scanned receiving reports (OCR), and complex spreadsheets. An interactive Telegram interface lets AR teams ask questions conversationally: "Why did you dispute the DC routing charge?" The AI explains its reasoning with contract citations.

**The Results: From Cost Center to Profit Center**

Within 90 days of deployment:

- **$2.4M annual recovery** – 68% dispute win rate on $3.5M in challenged deductions, recovering funds previously written off
- **95% time reduction** – Processing dropped from 8 hours to 4 minutes per payment notice, freeing AR team for strategic work
- **100% recall, 94% precision** – System catches every deduction claim while maintaining 94% accuracy in validation decisions
- **4x faster dispute response** – Average time from payment notice to dispute submission decreased from 12 days to 3 days, beating retailer deadlines
- **Improved vendor relationships** – Professional, evidence-based disputes (vs. rushed manual reviews) increased credibility with retailer AR teams

"The ROI was immediate," continued Chen. "Month one, we recovered $180,000 in invalid Dollar General chargebacks we would have accepted. By month three, we'd processed our entire backlog and identified $400,000 in disputable deductions we'd previously missed. The system paid for itself in 6 weeks."

**How It Works: Business Logic, Not Just Technology**

Unlike generic RPA or document processing tools, Altra-CPG's system encodes deep domain expertise:

- **Contract Intelligence** – Pre-loaded with Dollar General's 240-page vendor guide, Walmart's SQEP requirements, Kroger's standard vendor agreement, and Sam's Club compliance policies. Updates automatically when distributors release new versions.
- **Evidence Standards** – Knows that damage claims require photos within 48 hours, shortage claims need signed receiving reports, and pricing disputes require original POs—and flags violations automatically.
- **Calculation Verification** – Validates discount percentages, proration logic, and per-unit charges using contract-specified formulas.
- **Precedent Learning** – Tracks dispute outcomes (won/lost/partial) and incorporates resolution patterns into future validations.
- **Multi-Vendor Intelligence** – Handles distributor-specific deduction codes, evidence requirements, and dispute processes without manual configuration.

The system integrates with existing infrastructure (Gmail, NetSuite, Telegram) and required zero IT resources to deploy—the entire implementation was handled by the finance team using no-code workflow automation.

**Market Opportunity: A $50B Problem with No Good Solution**

Retailer deductions represent 2-5% of gross sales for CPG brands. With $1 trillion in US CPG retail sales annually, that's $20-50 billion in deductions—of which industry estimates suggest 20-35% are invalid or inflated. Yet 78% of mid-sized CPG brands still process deductions manually due to:

- **Complexity** – Each retailer has unique requirements; existing tools are single-vendor or require extensive customization
- **Lack of contract awareness** – OCR and document extraction alone don't validate claims against legal agreements
- **Evidence fragmentation** – Supporting documentation spans email, ERP, WMS, QMS, and paper files with no unified view
- **Decision paralysis** – Teams lack confidence to dispute without manual review, leading to "accept everything" defaults

Altra-CPG's approach—combining contract intelligence, multi-format processing, and AI reasoning—creates a defensible moat while addressing a massive underserved market.

**What's Next: Platform Play**

Following internal success, Altra-CPG is exploring opportunities to:

1. **Expand coverage** – Add remaining distributors (Target, Costco, regional chains) and international retailers
2. **Predictive analytics** – Identify deduction patterns that signal contract negotiation opportunities (e.g., "You're paying 3x industry average for DC routing errors—negotiate better terms")
3. **Vendor benchmarking** – Compare deduction rates and dispute win rates across retailers to optimize vendor relationships
4. **Platform licensing** – Package the system for other CPG brands facing identical challenges, creating a SaaS revenue stream from internal IP

"Every mid-sized CPG brand faces this exact problem," said Chen. "The vendor guides are public, the deduction codes are standardized, and the pain is universal. We built this for ourselves, but the market opportunity is 10,000+ brands collectively losing $10+ billion annually to invalid deductions. This isn't just automation—it's institutional knowledge at machine speed."

**Investment Opportunity**

Altra-CPG seeks strategic investment to accelerate platform development and go-to-market execution. The company has validated product-market fit internally (recovering 28x more than development costs in year one) and identified a clear path to horizontal expansion across the CPG industry. With 85% gross margins on recovered deductions and a repeatable playbook for adding new retailers, the business model combines high-margin services revenue with potential SaaS multiples.

**FAQ for Investors**

**Q: What makes this defensible vs. established AP automation vendors?**

A: Existing vendors (Bill.com, Coupa, etc.) focus on payables—automating invoice processing and payments. Deduction management is a receivables problem requiring contract intelligence, not just document extraction. Our system encodes domain expertise (retail compliance rules, evidence requirements, dispute tactics) that took years to build and is specific to CPG-retailer relationships. It's closer to a legal AI than traditional fintech.

**Q: How does this scale beyond Altra-CPG?**

A: The core IP—contract parsing, deduction validation logic, dispute generation—is 90% reusable across CPG brands. Retailer compliance guides are standardized and public. We've identified 2,400 US CPG brands with $10M+ revenue (our target market) experiencing identical pain. Initial go-to-market focuses on coffee/beverage brands where we have network effects, then expands to adjacent categories.

**Q: What's the TAM?**

A: $20-50B in annual retailer deductions × 25% invalid rate × 70% recoverable with automation = $3.5-8.75B addressable market. At 15% of recovery value (industry-standard contingency rate), that's $525M-1.3B in annual revenue potential. Our wedge is mid-market CPG ($10-100M revenue) representing ~$150M opportunity.

**Q: Why hasn't a large vendor solved this?**

A: Major ERPs (NetSuite, SAP) treat deductions as accounting entries—they record them but don't validate them. AP automation vendors focus on payables. Niche deduction management tools (like HighRadius) target enterprise brands ($1B+) with 18-month implementations and $500K+ price tags. The mid-market (our sweet spot) has been ignored because it requires product-market fit at lower price points—exactly where AI-driven automation creates margin.

**Q: What's the monetization model?**

A: Phase 1 (internal): Pure ROI from recovered deductions. Phase 2 (platform): Hybrid pricing: (a) SaaS subscription ($2-5K/month) for processing and dispute generation, (b) performance fee (10-15% of recovered deductions) to align incentives, (c) implementation services for contract loading and customization. Target $50-100K annual revenue per customer at 80%+ gross margins.

**Q: What are the key risks?**

A: (1) Retailers changing dispute processes to block automation—mitigated by professional, evidence-based disputes that strengthen vendor relationships. (2) Regulatory/legal concerns about AI making financial decisions—mitigated by human-in-the-loop for high-value disputes and full audit trails. (3) Contract complexity requiring extensive customization per customer—mitigated by standardization of retailer requirements across vendors.

**Q: What's required to scale?**

A: $1-2M seed round to: (1) hire 2 engineers to productize internal tooling, (2) hire 1 sales/CS lead with CPG networks, (3) build contract library for top 20 retailers, (4) pilot with 5 design partners in 6 months. Break-even at 15 customers ($900K ARR). Target 100 customers by year 2 ($6M ARR).
